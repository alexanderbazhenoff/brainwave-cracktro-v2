## TLDR

This sources is a Zilog Z80 Assembler in Alasm format. You should import and compile this source in [Alasm](https://zxart.ee/rus/soft/tool/music/pro-tracker-alasm/qid:365628/) ZX-Spectrum assembler [(I have used v5.08)](https://speccy.info/ALASM) to compile. Or convert this source manually for [SjASMPlus](http://speccy.info/SjASMPlus) which is crossplatform.

## Technical info

This crack intro uses a non-standard timing mode synchronized for [Pentagon-128K 2+](https://speccy.info/Pentagon), a russian ZX-Spectrum clone. Actually most of text pages will work on all ZX-Spectrum clone, but less screen synchronization (some parts of randomously moving sprites with text could miss because of outrun the ray). Some text pages could be slowed down on ZX-Spectrum clones with less than 71680 CPU tacts per frame, especially machines with slow memory. Since Pentagon-128K 2+ is a Russian and Ukrainian demoscene standard I don't care, sorry. At least you can watch youtube or emulator.

## Story

In yearly 00s I decided to make another fun cracktro, but as usually tired of waiting graphics logo. I started skipping classes at university step by step coding this cracktro. Indeed I can programming without stupid pascal lessons. But I still waited for a group logo.

Some month later I have seen a crack release of Bubbler game by Slider^BIS which was shorter on 8 TR-DOS sectors than mine. But one moment: some people could know, old days size of programs and the whole prestige on the scene was important. You can't do the shhh for your team name. So I started to optimize the code, c-jeff^bw (who is seajeff nowdays) cutted some minor patterns (you'll never hear them, but this is the additional size) from the awesome conversion by Megus, which was originally comes from 'Fat Cat Wants Tasty Fish' by Manwe^Sands. Then I have optimized a music player with Ivan Roshin's optimizator, which acutally explored some code coverage and remove unused bytes. Then I used a latest on those days packing technique RIP (Real Information Packer) by Roman Petrov. The size of the binary with crack intro becomes 7424 bytes or so (29 TR-DOS sectors). After that I didn't really worried is it more or lass than in Slider's release, it was good enough and it has music and action. But getting know that this buddy is still making crack releases for oldschool machine inspired me to do a few dozen more releases. Thank you guys for that good old days and co-working.
